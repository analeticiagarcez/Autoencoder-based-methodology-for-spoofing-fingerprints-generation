There are two configurations that can be used to obtain the results, they are:

* **Configuration 1** - Does not include the discriminator patch. This method uses the ``main_perceptual.py`` code

* **Configuration 2** - Includes the discriminator patch. This method uses the ``main_patchDisc.py`` code

To access the codes for fingerprint verification, use the VeriFinger folder.
